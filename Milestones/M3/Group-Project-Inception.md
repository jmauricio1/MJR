2019-20 Group Project Inception
=====================================

## Summary of Our Approach to Software Development
We will be running our web application through ASP.NET with MVC5. The website will be constantly deployed to prevent user interruption via Microsoft Azure web server hosting services. We will be using SpaceX’s API (httpsgithub.comr-spacexSpaceX-API) to display information about rocket launches. 

## Initial Vision Discussion with Stakeholders
For people who want to learn more about SpaceX and about space in general, the SpaceX Educational Website is an informational system that will allow people of a variety of ages to learn about what missions SpaceX has done and learn the specifics about it such as the rocket used, the payload it carried, its success or failure and other such features. The website will also include ways of teaching people about other aspects of space missions. Unlike the current website that SpaceX’s launch manifest is (httpswww.spacex.commissions), our product will be able to deliver more detailed information and in a format that is more appealing to younger audiences and is designed in a way to teach them what kind of work goes into each mission. We plan to implement things that are both enjoyable and educational, like quizzes and potentially even basic games to play that are space or SpaceX themed. A potential future implementation is a progress tracker to see how you’ve done  are doing on quizzes and which ones you have or haven’t completed, this feature will require that the visitor be logged in to a registered account.

## List of Needs and Features

A website with a visual design that appeals to people of any age and evokes the idea of space. Must be easy to find features and easily navigable.
Administrator accounts will be needed to edit or addremove information on the website. All other features are available publically, however in the future users may register for an account to have their completed tasks shown in a progress tracker.
The ability to retrieve and display data of SpaceX missions via the SpaceX API.
An Orbit Finder that would allow a user to project orbit of an object based on that object’s eccentricity, distances from Earth and other data metrics. 
A Launch Tester to see if a launch makes it into orbit
The ability to have small apps such as games or quizzes be playable on the website.
