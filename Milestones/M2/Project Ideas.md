Idea 1: Employee/Employer Search
What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
Original: We would like to develop features that aren’t necessarily available through other major options. Primarily a focus on distance based job searching, prospective employees should be able to dictate in a mile range how far they are willing to commute and if they are willing to relocate or not. If unwilling to relocate, they should only be shown jobs within their commute range. Employers would be able to see how far a prospective employee is willing to commute and if relocation is available.
Related sites/apps: LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor (business evaluation), Monster (job search)
Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?
Nearly everyone is looking for a job and most prospective employees aren’t willing to relocate or desire to have a limited commute time. We want to make it easier for prospective employees to find jobs within their local areas and for employers to be able to find nearby prospects or ones that are willing to relocate. It’s useful as a tool to those who are seeking for employees or those who are seeking employers which covers a large potential audience.
What are a few major features?
Profiles for both prospective employees and employers
Prospective employees can create a profile for themselves. (location, level of schooling, contact information, resume, etc). Employers should be able to do the same for the jobs they are offering (Place of business, address/location, type of business, type of employment, etc). 
The ability for a prospective employee to search for potential jobs using specific filters.
The ability for an employer to search for potential employees using specific filters.
Prospective employees can look at and apply for jobs.
Employers can look through jobs for their company, look through people that have applied for the job, and accept or deny them.
What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.
Possible APIs: Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Monster(Job Search API) → Sources: https://www.programmableweb.com/news/70-jobs-apis-indeed-simply-hired-and-careerbuilder/2013/01/23
Some sort of API for tracking distance (mapquest, google maps?)
What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)
Primarily it would be searching algorithms based on filters. The prospective employees would need the ability to search based on their filters for potential jobs and the employers should be able to search for prospective employees based on their own filters.
Potentially an algorithm that suggests potential available employers/employees based on your past filtered searches. IE. If an employer frequently searches for jobs within a 30 mile radius, it may suggest to them a job opening that’s 25 miles away.
Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.
7ish. A lot of features to implement overall, working with effectively 2 different user types that need to be able to interact effectively with one another. 

Idea 2: SpaceX Educational
What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
We want to expand upon the information that is available on the currently available products, which is limited and present it in a fashion that is fun/easy to learn for people that want to know more about these missions. Designed primarily as an education tool.
Related Apps/Sites: Nasa’s Missions (https://www.nasa.gov/missions) and SpaceX’s flight manifesto, SpaceX flight manifesto (https://www.spacex.com/missions)
Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?
It is designed to be educational for minds that are still impressionable. Our target audience is somewhere in the 10-18 year old range and we want to be able to give them the ability to learn more about space flights than is currently available on SpaceX’s own website/mission manifesto. It’s useful as a tool to expand minds and expand information and we would have the ability and desire to present it in a fun and educationally invoking manner.
What are a few major features?
Learning about different launches conducted by SpaceX: In this feature, we would be able to point out information from a specific launch like the rocket type, where and when was the launch conducted, if it was a manned mission, the payloads and the timeline of a successful or unsuccessful launch
Orbit Finder: We would be able to project orbit of an object based on that object’s eccentricity, distances from Earth(Form/POST Request)
Launch Tester: Test to see if a launch makes it into orbit(Form/POST Request)

Related/Suggestion Algorithm based on past launches that you have viewed
Sorting/Searching algorithm based on specific aspect of launches, like their duration, if they have succeeded or not etc.

4-5, simplicity is a bit lower on the scale here but part of the true challenge would be in how to display the information in a fun and educational manner

Idea 3: Pantry Manager/Dinner Selector
What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
What’s original about this idea is hybridizing two ideas into one. The first portion would be a personal pantry manager, able to keep track of what you currently have available to the user as cooking materials. Part 2 would be a meal suggester that would work based on available ingredients in your kitchen.
Related Apps/Sites: Allrecipes Dinner Spinner app, Pantry Manager ios app
Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?
It offers a way to minimize decision making when it comes to meals / meal time preparation. It offers a way to know what you have in stock and if you can’t figure out what you want to make out of it, you have the app to help you out. It’s useful to all those who might find themselves asking the question “What do you want for dinner?” all too often. 
What are a few major features?
A pantry manager → This would be the ability to catalog what you have available to you in your current pantry. Items should be mutable, adding too or removing quantities of items should be a simple and painless process. 
A meal suggester → This would have the ability to suggest a meal based on currently available ingredients. Potentially this could be two features, one that suggests recipes for ingredients on hand and another that would suggest a recipe using some ingredients you have but requires shopping for more. 
The ability to filter results based on specific dietary needs potentially.

The meal suggestion methodology itself will be an algorithm with potential for dietary filters and restrictions.

5ish, connecting two different ideas into one functional app might provide it’s own challenges. Especially if users are given freedom to enter information, how do you differentiate between ‘spaghetti sauce’ and ‘marinara sauce’ or ‘spaghetti noodle’ and ‘spagetti noodle’.
