        <h2>Sun Information</h2>

        <div style="">
            <h3>Why is it called The Sun?</h3>
            The Sun is the name of the star that is in the center of our solar system. <br>
            Its name comes from the old english sonne which comes from the German word Sonne. <br>
            Other names include the Greek Helios and the Latin Sol .
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>How was it created?</h3>
            The Sun was formed about 4.5 billion years ago after gravity had compressed particles of gas and dust together under the force of gravity which eventually formed what we know as the Sun.
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>How far away is the Sun?</h3>
            The Sun on average is 150 million kilometres (93 million miles) away from earth. <br>
            This is equal to 1 astronomical unit or AU which is commonly used as a measurement of distance for objects in space.
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>How big is The Sun?</h3>
            The sun is about 864,938 miles (1.392 million km) wide. This is over 100 times bigger than the width of the earth. <br>
            The total volume of the sun is 1.4 x 1027cubic meters. This means that the sun could fit about 1.3 million Earths inside it.<br> 
            The mass of the sun is 1.989 x 1030 kilograms which is about 333,000 times larger than Earth’s mass.  <br>
            The Sun on its own accounts for 99.86% of the total mass in the Solar System.

            <h3>What makes up The Sun?</h3>
            The Sun is mostly composed of helium and hydrogen at temperatures up to 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius).<br> 
            The inner layers of the sun are the core, followed by the radiative zone, and the convection zone.<br> 
            The outer layers of the Sun start with the photosphere as the innermost layer followed by the chromosphere, transition region, and then the outermost corona.
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>What are Solar Winds and Solar Flares?</h3>
            The Sun produces solar wind which can reach speeds of up to 500 miles (800 kilometers) per second. <br>
            The material the winds carry large amounts of radiation towards the earth which would cause extreme damage, but the Earth is protected from this radiation due to the Earth's magnetosphere. <br>
            Another thing the Sun can do is called a solar flare which is a burst of energy from the Sun’s surface.<br>
            These can cause events on earth such as auroras but can also cause problems with radio communication and power outages.
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>What are Solar Elipses?</h3>
            The Sun will also periodically have a solar eclipse which happens when the moon gets between the Earth and the Sun which casts a shadow on the Earth.<br>
            Solar eclipses come in one of four forms being either total, annular, partial, and hybrid each having a different amount of the sun being blocked.<br>
            It is important to remeber that even though some of the Sun is blocked does not mean that it is safe to look at it without protection.
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>Why is The Sun Important?</h3>
            The Sun itself is very important to life on Earth as it is the way that Earth is warmed which would make life impossible without it.<br> 
            It is also an important part for plants on earth that need the energy from the Sun for photosynthesis<br>
            The gravity of the Sun also keeps our planet in our solar system without it we would go flying into who knows where.
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Other Facts</h3>
            For a long time up until the 16th century it was widely regarded that Earth was the center of the Solar System until the Polish astronomer Nicolai Copernicus wrote a model that described why the Sun must be the center of our Solar System.<br>
            People used to tell times using an object called a sun dial which used the Sun's light to cast a shadow on the dial's face which would look similar to modern day clocks.'
