        <h3>What is The Andromeda Galaxy?</h3>
        The Andromeda Galaxy is the closest spiral galaxy to our Milky Way Galaxy.<br>
        It also goes by the names M31 or Messier 31. [<a href="https://www.space.com/15590-andromeda-galaxy-m31.html">REF</a>]

        <h3>How was The Andromeda Galaxy discovered?</h3>
        The other names come from Charles Messier who wrote about the galaxy that he thought was a nebula. [<a href="https://www.space.com/16686-charles-messier-biography.html">REF</a>]<br>
        Edwin Hubble in the 1920s discovered that Andromeda was much larger than originally thought and helped reclassify Andromeda as a galaxy.<br>
        This started the idea that the universe is filled with more galaxies than just the Milky Way. [<a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960406.html">REF</a>]

        <h3>How far away is The Andromeda Galaxy?</h3>
        Andromeda is 2.5 million lightyears away. [<a href="https://www.space.com/15590-andromeda-galaxy-m31.html">REF</a>]<br>
        The Andromeda Galaxy has an apparent magnitude(brightness) of 3.6 so it is bright enough to be visible from Earth. [<a href="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cms/astro/cosmos/A/Andromeda+galaxy">REF</a>]

        <h3>How does The Andromeda Galaxy compare to our Milky Way Galaxy?</h3>
        The Andromeda Galaxy is around 222,000 light years across more than double your Milky Way Galaxy at 100,000 light years across. [<a href="https://www.universetoday.com/22821/the-milky-way-and-andromeda/">REF</a>]<br>
        Andromeda also has a higher amount of stars at around 1 trillion stars compared to the around 200-400 billion in the Milky Way. [<a href="http://annesastronomynews.com/photo-gallery-ii/galaxies-clusters/the-andromeda-galaxy-m31/">REF</a>]

        <h3>What will happen to our galaxies in the future?</h3>
        The Andromeda Galaxy will one day collide with the Milky Way Galaxy. It is estimated that it will happen in around 4 billion years and they will completely merge in around 6 billion years.<br>
        This is something that is common with many galaxies and both the Milky Way and Andromeda show signs of having collided with other galaxies before.[<a href="https://www.space.com/15590-andromeda-galaxy-m31.html">REF</a>]

        <h3>Other facts about The Andromeda Galaxy</h3>
        In 2017 it was discovered that the Andromeda Galaxy contained two different black holes.<br>
        These were special as they orbit each other at a distance that may only be a couple 100 times the distance between the Earth and Sun.<br>
        Because they are relatively close the two black holes will eventually merge in anywhere from 350 to 360,000 years. [<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/news/giant-black-hole-pair-photobombs-andromeda-galaxy.html">REF</a>]
