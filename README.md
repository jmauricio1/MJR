## Astronomical Learning Project
This project is a website focused around teaching younger audiences about space related topics including our solar system, the universe, and missions conducted by major space related companies such as Nasa and SpaceX. Our goal is to make the website as interesting and engaging as possible to our target audience.

### Vision Statement
>For those interested in all things space who want to learn more about SpaceX and NASA missions and space itself, the Astronomical Learning Website is an informational system that will allow people of all ages to 
>learn about SpaceX, NASA and space in a variety of ways. Visitors will be able to see what missions SpaceX and NASA have completed and be able to view various information about each mission. The website will also 
>include other ways of teaching people about what goes into space missions and other aspects of space. This will include interactive media such as games and quizzes. Unlike SpaceX’s launch manifest (https://
>www.spacex.com/missions), our product will be able to deliver more detailed information about SpaceX missions and in a format that is more appealing to younger audiences alongside a much larger scope of topics.
